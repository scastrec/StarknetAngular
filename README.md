# AngularStarknet

**[WIP]** Let's play with Starknet on Angular

Based on [Starknet Counter](https://book.starknet.io/ch02-09-01-counter-ui.html#abi-application-binary-interface) and [Cairo1JS](https://github.com/PhilippeR26/Cairo1JS) for the counter contract.

## Tested
* Only with ArgentX connection for now

## Run
`ng serve`
